Key Questions to Answer
We'll structure the analysis into two sections:



üü¢ Part 1: Content Strategy Analysis (What Type of Content is Popular?)
‚úÖ What is the ratio of Movies vs. TV Shows?
Key Insights:
Netflix‚Äôs library consists of 69.69% Movies and 30.31% TV Shows.
For every 1 TV Show, there are approximately 2.3 Movies available on the platform.
This suggests that Netflix prioritizes Movies over TV Shows, possibly due to easier production and licensing compared to multi-season series.
However, TV Shows might still contribute higher user engagement since they encourage longer viewing time (binge-watching).

‚úÖ What are the most common genres on Netflix?
Key Insights
International content dominates Netflix, with International Movies (31%) and International TV Shows (15%) making up nearly half of the platform‚Äôs content.
Dramas (27%) and Comedies (19%) are the most popular genres, showing Netflix‚Äôs focus on engaging storytelling.
Documentaries (9%) and Action & Adventure (9%) also have a significant presence, catering to both information-seeking and thrill-seeking audiences.
TV Dramas (8%) and Independent Movies (8%) suggest Netflix also supports niche and indie films.
Family-friendly content (Children & Family Movies ‚Äì 7%) and Romantic Movies (7%) show Netflix‚Äôs effort to appeal to multiple demographics.
Netflix appears to be heavily invested in international content and dramatic storytelling, while also balancing popular entertainment genres like Action, Comedy, and Romance.

‚úÖ Which countries produce the most content?
Key Insights
The United States dominates Netflix content, accounting for 36% of all shows and movies on the platform.
India (12%) is the second-largest contributor, highlighting the importance of Bollywood and Indian TV for Netflix‚Äôs global expansion.
The United Kingdom (7%) ranks third, reinforcing its strong film and television industry.
Pakistan (4%) appears in the top 5, which is surprising and suggests increasing investment in South Asian content.
Canada (3%), Japan (2%), South Korea (2%), France (2%), and Spain (2%) contribute to Netflix‚Äôs international catalog.

‚úÖ How has Netflix‚Äôs content library changed over time?
Key Insights
1Ô∏è‚É£ Netflix started expanding aggressively in 2015, adding 241% more content than in 2014.
2Ô∏è‚É£ The biggest growth years were 2016 and 2017, with Netflix adding 426 titles in 2016 (419% growth) and 1,185 titles in 2017 (178% growth).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Netflix‚Äôs library peaked in 2019, with 2,016 new shows/movies added that year.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Content additions slowed in 2020 and 2021, with a 6.8% drop in 2020 and a major 20.28% drop in 2021.

This was likely due to COVID-19 disrupting film production.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Netflix shifted from rapid expansion (2015-2019) to a more controlled content strategy post-2020.
üìå Netflix‚Äôs content strategy moved from massive expansion (2015-2019) to a more focused, possibly quality-driven approach in 2020 and beyond.



üîµ Part 2: User Engagement Analysis (What Attracts Viewers?)
‚úÖ Which ratings (TV-MA, PG-13, TV-Y7) are most common?
Key Insights
1Ô∏è‚É£ Netflix primarily targets mature audiences, with TV-MA (36%) and TV-14 (24%) making up 60% of total content.
TV-MA (Mature Audiences) is the most common rating, meaning Netflix prioritizes adult-themed content.
TV-14 (Teens 14+) follows closely, suggesting a secondary focus on teenage audiences.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Family-friendly content makes up a much smaller share, with PG-13 (5%), TV-Y7 (3%), TV-Y (3%), and TV-G (2%) together accounting for less than 15% of total content.
This suggests Netflix doesn‚Äôt invest heavily in children's programming compared to other categories.
3Ô∏è‚É£ R-rated movies (9%) are less common than TV-MA shows (36%), meaning Netflix leans toward TV content rather than explicit R-rated films.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Very few titles are G-rated (0%), meaning Netflix is not a strong competitor for very young children's programming (compared to Disney+).
üìå Overall, Netflix‚Äôs content is largely targeted at adults and teenagers, with a lower focus on kids and family-friendly programming.

‚úÖ Is Netflix focusing more on recent releases or older content?
Netflix‚Äôs catalog is heavily focused on recent content, with over 70% of its shows and movies released after 2015.
This suggests Netflix prioritizes newer releases, either through original productions or acquiring recent content.
Netflix likely favors fresh content to attract subscribers rather than relying on an extensive classic movie library.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Only 5.97% of content is from before 2000, meaning Netflix does not prioritize older, classic films & shows.
Unlike platforms such as HBO Max (Warner Bros. classics) or Disney+ (older animated films), Netflix doesn‚Äôt focus on legacy content.
This could indicate that Netflix's audience prefers newer content over older classics.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Moderately old content (2000-2014) still makes up 23% of Netflix‚Äôs catalog, but it‚Äôs much smaller than recent releases.
Shows and movies from this era include blockbusters and hit TV series (e.g., early 2000s sitcoms and action movies).
Netflix still licenses some older content, but it's not the primary focus.
üìå Netflix is clearly focusing on fresh, recently released content rather than building a massive archive of old movies and TV shows.
